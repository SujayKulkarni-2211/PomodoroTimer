# Pomodoro Timer with Task Tracking

This Pomodoro Timer project is an expansion of the timer functionality taught by Angela Yu in the 100 Days of Python course on Udemy. While the course focused on timer, UI, and Tkinter, I extended it by incorporating sound cues and SQLite integration for task tracking.

## Features
- Pomodoro timer for work sessions
- Short breaks and long breaks
- Task tracking with SQLite database
- Sound cues for session transitions
- Simple and intuitive UI with Tkinter

## How to Use
1. Enter the name of your task and click "Add Task".
2. Start the Pomodoro work session by clicking "Start Pomodoro Work Session".
3. Track completed tasks and view task information using the provided buttons.
4. Reset the timer at any time by clicking "Reset Timer".
